# Overview

This project is a Matlab implementation of a structural FEM code originally developed as part of T. Fitzgerald dissertation.  This particular version is the foundation on which we'll build
1. Normal modes (for simple structures)
2. Continuation of the normal modes


# Contents

The directories below constitute the major routines of the code:
- assemble
- notes
- postproc
- preprocmesh
- shapefunctions
- testing

# To Do
Lots of things.
1. Add damping?
2. Cleanup postproc routines, it's a mess.
3. Add nonlinear time stepping routine
4. Add Large-scale Finite-difference scheme to describe limit cycle
